                The company started in 2024 with a Capital of M100000. During his journey on sourcing 
                funds, Kenneth partnered with Shadrack, who joined as a second CEO of the company. 
                The mandate of IWB is to recycle computer parts; mainly the RAM, Hard Drives and 
                Components of a motherboard. In 2025, the company penetrated the market and became

                of IWB attracted investors, partners and clients outside of Lesotho. <br>
